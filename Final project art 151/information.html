<h3>Saturn's tiny moon</h3>
<p>NASA's Cassini detected oxygen in the atmosphere of Saturn's tiny moon Dione. "We now know that Dione, in addition to Saturn's rings and the moon Rhea, is a source of oxygen molecules," says Cassini team member, Robert Tokar. "This shows that molecular oxygen is actually common in the Saturn system and reinforces that it can come from a process that doesn't involve life.".</p>

<h3>Space Photo of the Day 2013</h3>
<p>Amazing photo of the Orion nebula's center, a cloud of gas and dust known as M42. Image: Adam Block at the Mount Lemon Sky Center observatory in Arizona. This is a picture of the Orion nebula. It was taken with a new camera that allows telescopes on Earth to counteract the effects of atmospheric distortion, creating images twice as sharp as the Hubble space telescope.</p>
